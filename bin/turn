turn(board)

#turn cannot be built with turn(index, board) because index is out of scope here. we have to call turn with board, then the method turn will declare index.
#the above call to method #turn will only execute 1 turn
#this code is incomplete. Items we need to add 1. Method to change characters 2. method to end game once three in a row are matched 3. method to change turns
